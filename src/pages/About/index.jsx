      <h2>The League </h2>
      <p>
        The Spice League is an assembly of close friends & football fans that
        convene every year for a fantasy football competition. Though the league
        has been around for several years, it experienced a change in leadership
        when Brad Deibert was appointed league commissioner in 2023. Gabby
        Delorme later joined as co-commissioner in 2025 during an unexpected
        Commissioner Crashout (TM).

              League since filling the role in 2023. He loves all things fantasy
              football, Green Bay Packers, and especially grown men acting their
              age when it comes to their fantasy team. (Hint: it makes his job
              much easier!)
