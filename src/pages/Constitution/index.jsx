			<h1>Constitution ðŸ“œ</h1>

			<h2>Format</h2>
			<p>The Spice League is a redraft league, meaning each team drafts an entirely new team each year.</p>

			<h2>Scoring</h2>
			<p>We play full PPR, with default Sleeper app scoring settings. Find more info on PPR scoring in the Sleeper app, or in this <a href='https://sleeper.com/blog/how-fantasy-football-scoring-systems-work/'>article</a>.</p>

			<h2>Draft</h2>
			<p>All team managers will have the opportunity to draft their own team. Auto-draft is allowed for all who choose to do so (or can't participate on draft day). Draft order is picked at random each year, and the format is a "snake" draft (meaning 12th pick in 1st rd. gets 1st pick in 2nd rd.). </p>

			<h2>Trades</h2>
			<p>The league will allow trades amongst league members up until the trade deadline. When 2 teams agree on a trade, it will be subject to a 2-day voting period, in which the league will vote to uphold or veto the trade. All votes must be cast in the Sleeper app, and a <strong>total of 7 votes (league majority) will be required to veto a trade.</strong></p> 
			<p>Note: Once you have cast your vote on a trade, it may not be changed under any circumstances. <strong>This is a zero tolerance policy, so make certain of your choice before casting your vote.</strong> The Commissioners reserve the right to reverse any trade at any time by their sole discretion (see "Commissioner Privilege").</p>

			<h2>Playoffs</h2>
			<p>The top 6 teams by regular season record will be entered into the playoff bracket. The top 2 teams by regular season record will receive a first-round bye. Any tiebreakers in the case of identical win-loss records will be determined by total points scored for each team. </p>

			<h2>Losers Bracket</h2>
			<p>The bottom 6 teams will be entered into the losers bracket. The worst 2 teams by regular season record will receive a first-round bye. Unlike than the regular playoff bracket, a loss in this bracket advances you to the next round. At the end, one team will have lost their way out and will become subject to the last place punishment.</p>

			<h2>Last Place Punishment</h2>
			<p>As explained above, the Spice League requires a punishment to be completed by the last place team's manager each season. Each year, the punishment should be agreed upon by league members by way of vote. It must be a "spicy food challenge" (hence the league name).</p>
			<p>The punishment must be completed by the last place team before buy-ins are collected for the following season. <strong>Failure to do so will result in the league member forfeiting their league spot for the following year.</strong></p>

			<h2>Tiebreakers</h2>
			<p>In the event of a tie (ex. same regular season records for playoff seeding, etc.), the team with the higher total points scored for the season will be concluded the winner.</p>

			<h2>Financials</h2>
			<p>All league buy-ins must be collected by the agreed upon deadline - this is considered your ticket to play for the season. Additionally, the cost to conduct the Last Place Punishment will be split evenly amongst all league members. Please pay these dues directly to the Commissioner on Venmo or Cash App.</p>
			<p>Pay-outs will be sent to the winner(s) shortly after the conclusion of the season's final games (~about 1 week).</p>

			<h2>Delinquency</h2>
			<p>The Spice League prides itself on maintaining a competitive and engaged league. To that end, there will be consequences for members who continuously fail to meet their obligations.</p>
			<p><strong>Unset lineups</strong> - League members who repeatedly fail to set their lineups during the season may be subject to removal from the league.</p>
	
			<h2>Commissioner Privilege</h2>
			<p>Everything in this handbook is subject to change and override as found necessary by the Commissioners.</p>
